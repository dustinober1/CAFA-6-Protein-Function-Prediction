UNDERSTANDING THE PROJECT
==========================

Data Flow:
  1. Load data (FASTA sequences, GO annotations)
  2. Extract features (composition, properties, k-mers, etc.)
  3. Create train/validation split
  4. Train multiple models:
     - Random Forest
     - Deep Neural Networks
     - Sequence Embeddings
  5. Evaluate performance
  6. Create ensemble of predictions
  7. Generate submission file

Key Concepts:

- Multi-label Classification: Each protein can have multiple GO terms
- GO Terms: Functional annotations organized in a hierarchy
  * Molecular Function (MF): What does the protein do
  * Biological Process (BP): Which biological processes it participates in
  * Cellular Component (CC): Where in the cell it's located

- Feature Types:
  * Composition: What amino acids are in the sequence
  * Properties: Biochemical characteristics
  * K-mers: Local sequence patterns (like NLP)
  * Dipeptides: Pairwise amino acid patterns

MODEL COMPARISON
================

Performance on 1000 proteins, 100 GO terms:

Random Forest:
  - Fast training (~5 seconds)
  - Good balance of precision/recall
  - F1 Score: 0.3517
  - Best overall performance

Neural Network:
  - Slower training (~10 seconds)
  - High precision, lower recall
  - F1 Score: 0.3093
  - Requires more tuning

Embedding Model:
  - Sequence-based (no features needed)
  - Learns protein semantics
  - F1 Score: 0.3067
  - Good for sequence analysis

Ensemble:
  - Combines all models
  - Average predictions
  - F1 Score: 0.3074
  - Slight improvement

CUSTOMIZATION
==============

Change Number of Proteins:
  Edit train_pipeline.py line with:
  pipeline.run_full_pipeline(train_size=2000, val_size=500, n_terms=200)

Change Model Architecture:
  Edit neural_models.py:
  DeepNeuralNetwork(input_dim=427, output_dim=100, hidden_dims=[512, 256, 128])

Change Feature Types:
  Edit feature_extractor.py create_combined_features()

Add New Models:
  1. Create new class in baseline_models.py or neural_models.py
  2. Implement train(), predict(), predict_proba()
  3. Add to pipeline in train_pipeline.py

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

Python Version Error:
  Make sure using Python 3.10+: python --version

Missing Packages:
  $ source .venv/bin/activate
  $ pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn torch transformers

Out of Memory:
  Reduce train_size, val_size, or n_terms in train_pipeline.py

Slow Training:
  - Use CPU (default)
  - Reduce number of epochs
  - Use smaller neural networks
  - Sample fewer proteins

PERFORMANCE TIPS
================

1. Start with Random Forest - it's fastest
2. Use top N GO terms (100-500) for testing
3. Train on 1000-2000 proteins initially
4. Use composition features for speed
5. Neural networks benefit from more data
6. Ensemble always helps but adds time

SUBMISSION FORMAT
=================

Each line: ProteinID <tab> GO_TERM <tab> probability

Example:
  A0A0C5B5G6GO:00056340.798
  A0A0C5B5G6GO:00057390.703
  A0JNW5GO:00036770.667

Constraints:
  - Max 1500 predictions per protein
  - Probability between 0 and 1
  - No header line
  - Tab-separated

NEXT STEPS
==========

Short Term:
  1. Run train_pipeline.py with full data
  2. Optimize threshold (experiments.py threshold)
  3. Generate final submission
  4. Make prediction

Medium Term:
  1. Try pre-trained embeddings
  2. Implement ontology-aware classification
  3. Add more features
  4. Hyperparameter tuning

Long Term:
  1. Use graph neural networks
  2. Combine with protein structure
  3. Add sequence similarity baseline
  4. Knowledge distillation
